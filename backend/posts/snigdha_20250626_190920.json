Maintaining *Snigdha* qualities is achieved through various practices, including:\n\n* **Oil massage (Abhyanga):** Regular massage with warm, medicated oils helps nourish the skin, improve circulation, and promote relaxation.  This is a cornerstone of Ayurvedic skincare and contributes significantly to a Snigdha state.\n* **Dietary choices:** Including healthy fats like ghee (clarified butter) and coconut oil in your diet supports internal lubrication and overall health.\n* **Herbal remedies:** Certain herbs and botanicals are known to promote Snigdha qualities.  These often feature in Ayurvedic oils and creams, contributing to healthy skin and hair.\n\nThe pursuit of a \"Snigdha\" state isn't merely about aesthetics; it's about cultivating a balance within the body, promoting optimal health, and enhancing overall well-being.
